Contains ppt of No-dues Alumni website

Students are supposed to get their no dues cleared for each department at the end of the degree or at any point they want to leave the college, which is a very tedious and painstaking job. Each Student has to go to every particular department to get their no dues signed by the respective authorities of the department so that if there are any dues then they must be cleared. Therefore we have developed a no-dues management system that will generate a computerized no-dues form showing the dues status. With the help of the same it will be also easier to keep track of the alumni which in turn will benefit the institute and the students.
